          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.(Not visible)</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. </li>

          <li> git pull origin main: pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>

        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses (). Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the parentheses. </li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
        <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
